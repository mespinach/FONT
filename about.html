FONT- FIND OUT NEEDED TYPEFACES happened when an engineer wanted to solve a graphic designer's problem. <br>
Typography is an integral feature of a brand or a design creative. While working as a graphic designer, I would often come across the pains of guessing the font/typeface of the requirement from the given reference by just eye-balling it. It is a trial and error process to find out the font which your client wants you to use. 
<br>
Or it can be as simple as- You see a graphic somewhere and it inspires you and you want to use that typeface next time in your work but again, you just have to guess it. Sometimes, you don't even know thhe particular typeface to guess. in the first place.
<br>
Project FONT is conceived to recognize typefaces/fonts. For this, one just has to take an image of the required typeface-sample and feed it to the application and boom! It tells you the font!
